**Selenium Automation Framework with Java, TestNG, and Docker  **
**Project Overview**
This project is an automated testing framework built using Selenium and Java 11 JRE. It employs a combination of Keyword-Driven, Data-Driven, and Hybrid frameworks, with support for Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodologies. The framework leverages TestNG for test execution and reporting, while Docker is integrated for environment consistency and ease of deployment.

**Features**
Selenium WebDriver: For browser automation.
Keyword-Driven Framework: Simplifies test automation by using keywords for each action performed on the web elements.
Data-Driven Framework: Enables testing with different sets of data.
Hybrid Framework: Combines the benefits of both Keyword-Driven and Data-Driven frameworks for maximum flexibility.
BDD/TDD Support: Write tests in a behavior-driven style using tools like Cucumber or maintain test-driven development practices.
TestNG: Provides test execution, parallel testing, and reporting.
Java 11 JRE: Ensures compatibility with modern Java features.
Docker: Containerization of the test environment for consistency across different systems.

**Prerequisites**
Java 11 JRE: Make sure Java 11 is installed and configured on your system.
Maven/Gradle: For dependency management.
Docker: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine.
